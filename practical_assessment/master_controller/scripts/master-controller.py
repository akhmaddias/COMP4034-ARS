'''
The root controller class for the Turtlebot3 Waffle.
This implements an object search behaviour that enables the robot to search
for predefined objects visible in the robotâ€™s camera. The controller selects
the most appropriate behaviour based on what is occuring.

Behaviour priority is as follows:
    ~ Recovery behaviour (to escape from being wedged or trapped)
    ~ Collision avoidance (to avoid colliding into items in the scene)
    ~ Navigation to objects (to move from the current position to the object of interest)
    ~ Object detection (to highlight an object of interest and trigger navigation to object)
    ~ Map navigation (drives the robot between waypoints in order to
        navigate the environment)
    ~ Random walk (if no waypoints have been given, walk randomly until something happens)
